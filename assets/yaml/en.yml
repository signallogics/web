concept_checker: >
  Checker must be from a script written in bash or python (or using any shell which is the default debian jessie). <br/>
  Chequer should not be available to other teams (the organizers will publish it ourselves) <br/>
  Example of call for that would put a flag: ./checker put 172.17.0.65 someid3 4FE93926-55E6-47E7-9089-9BDED570B631 <br/>
  An example of a call to check that would flag: ./checker get 172.17.0.65 someid3 4FE93926-55E6-47E7-9089-9BDED570B631 <br/>
  Code 200 indicates that all is well (flag set / flag found / service checking) <br/>
  Code 404 indicates that the service is bad and lost. <br/>
  Code 423 indicates that the service is broken or that the flag is not found. <br/>
  Other codes are not considered valid and recognized checker incorrect. <br>
  File Checker should be called checker, to be executable (chmod + x checker) and lie in the directory with the sending service. <br>

concept_service: >
  Service is best to wrap the container in the docker (Dockerfile). <br/>
  Service should not be available to other teams (the organizers will publish it ourselves) <br/>
  Must be at least 2 vulnerabilities. <br/>
  Must be installed ssh server. <br/>
  There must be a script: rebuild.sh that will remove the old containers and create new service. <br/>
  Must be installed README.md that records the date, time, service and author of his contacts and additional information. <br/>
  Also be sure to presence of a presentation describing the vulnerability and how to close them - everything else is optional. <br/>

concept_video: >
  The video can not be published (the organizers will publish its own). <br/>
  The video must have a friendly greet. <br/>
  Demonstration of exploitation and its elimination. <br/>
  Being normal quality. <br/>
